''' Form tasks are a plugin to the core basic functionalities that is included by default and tries to show off what the system is  capable of integrating.

    The system uses the json syntax presented for form schema by the formbuilder project. Which can be seen here: https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder . This makes it easier to integrate this type of tasks, as we use a modified version of the formbuilder on the UI extra component.
