"""
    Documents are always an important part of any task manager, after all usually tasks end up generating a series of documents or other resources as a product of related work. Even if they do not generate input, they almost always will have input documents related to concluding a task. In our hybrid system, we also decided to give them special attention.

    In this spirit, we tried to allow documents on the system to be an integral part of all processes. More than that documents are implemented as generic resources through MTI, so even although for the basic system we just suport File resources, we will be eventually able to cater to other types of more dynamic resources without having to change our core. Resources are so important that process intervenients can comment upon resources, and discuss them directly.

    Resources are received from dependencies, and are passed down to dependants through the system being effectively the vehicle of communication for the task executioners in the system.
