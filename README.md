# TASKA
#### A modular and easily extendable system for repeatable workflows


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/bioinformatics-ua/taska/tree/master)

Task management systems are crucial tools in modern organizations, by simplifying the coordination of teams and their work. Those tools were developed mainly for task scheduling, assignment, follow-up, and accountability. On the other hand, scientific workflow systems also appeared to help putting together a set of computational processes through the pipeline of inputs and outputs from each, creating in the end a more complex processing workflow. However, there is sometimes a lack of solutions that combine both manually operated tasks with automatic processes, in the same workflow system.

TASKA is a web-based platform that incorporates some of the best functionalities of both systems, addressing the collaborative needs of a task manager with well-structured computational pipelines.
The system is currently being used by EMIF (European Medical Information Framework) for the coordination of clinical studies.


### Tech

TASKA uses a number of open source projects to work properly, such as:

<pre>
* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [NPM] - The frontend package manager
* [Django] - Web framework python-based
* [Django Rest Framework] - Toolkit for building Web APIs in Django projects
* [PostgreSQL] - The object-relational database management system
* [Docker] - The computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization
* [Make] -  Utility for building and maintaining groups of programs
</pre>

### Installation

Taska requires Docker, Docker-compose and Make to run.

Install Docker

<pre>
* Full instructions here https://docs.docker.com/install/
</pre>

Install docker-compose

<pre>
* Full instructions here https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
</pre>

Edit docker-compose.yml with deploy specific details. The varibles that should be configured are the following:

```sh
11  - POSTGRES_USER= user used in the postgreSQL. This user should match wih the user used in row 23
12  - POSTGRES_PASS= password used in the postgreSQL. This password should match wih the user used in row 23
...
10 - "xxxx:8000" change the xxxx for the port to access the container
...      
25 - DOCKER_POSTGRES_USER= user used in the postgreSQL.
26 - DOCKER_POSTGRES_PASS= password used in the postgreSQL. 
27 - DOCKER_POSTGRES_DB= database name
28 - DOCKER_POSTGRES_HOST= host name, default is the container defined in the docker-compose file
29 - DOCKER_POSTGRES_PORT= db container port
...
30 - DOCKER_SECRET=place_your_secret_here # secret salted used on passwords
# The following 5 rows are related with the settings to the email system
31 - EMAIL_USE_TLS=
32 - EMAIL_HOST=
33 - EMAIL_PORT=
34 - EMAIL_HOST_USER=
35 - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
36 - EMAIL_URL= #System url that will be added in some email templates
37 - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL= # the from address in the emails
...
42 - PUBLIC_IP= # the associated domain must be specified, to prevent fake HTTP Host headers
...
45 - BASE_DIR=/taska # if the page wont run on root but on a subdirectory instead it must be specified here
...
48 - RAVEN_URL= # raven url for error logging
```
 
After the costumization of the docker-compose file, it is only necessary perform the following commands to have the installation running. (This process can take a few minutes)

```sh
$ make
$ make run
```
